# ML Sandbox

Sandbox for Machine Learning testing

## Installation

Requires Python 3 (the code is tested on Python 3.9).

Requires Pip.

Requires the following packages.

```
pip install joblib
pip install notebook
pip install numpy
pip install tensorflow
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow

pip install scikeras
```

## Usage

`mlSandbox.py` is intended to be used across all datasets.

The Boston Housing Dataset is attached as an example. Create another file `housing.py` for each dataset to use the functions in `mlSandbox.py`.

The code can create and train a linear regression and a neural network.
